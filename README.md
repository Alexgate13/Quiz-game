🛠️ How It Works
Launches a window titled "My first window"

Displays a "Start" button

After clicking "Start", questions are shown one by one

Users select the answer via radio buttons and click "Next"

The app checks answers and tracks the score

A countdown timer starts at 10 seconds

⚠️ Notes & Improvements
Timer currently does not stop the quiz or enforce a time limit per question

Final score display and quiz completion screen are not implemented

Could benefit from better UI styling and dynamic question handling using a list/dictionary
